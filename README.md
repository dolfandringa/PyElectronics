This package is a tiny package to aid in electronics calculations. I wrote it to be able to easily do 555 timer calculations for an aquaponics project I am working on. But I think it is nice to have this library to be able to do electronics calculations in any application. I started using it in the commandline using iPython, but now also included it in my AquaponicsModeler application which uses the library to model a pump, driven by a 555-timer switch.

The package can be installed by going to http://allican.be/PyElectronics/. Download the zip file there and unpack it. Then on the commandline run `python setup.py install`
